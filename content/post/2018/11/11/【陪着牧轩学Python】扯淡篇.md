# Python 是啥

Java是一门哲学，哈哈！

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```

# Python 干啥的

现在越来越多人用Python做各种程序，小到一个小程序，大到一个大型Web程序。Python有一个最大的优势是库多！对，没看错，库超级多，只有你想不到，没有Python做不到！（牛皮吹破了！）

# 为啥学Python

说实话，我是一个`.NET`的忠实粉丝，虽然偶尔会背叛，利用Java做一些工具和使用C++做开发。我靠是不是很乱，我也很乱。

Python与其说是一个开发语言不如说一个开发工具，是一个脚本（当然比`bat`和`shell`更牛×！）。Python都已经加入高考了，你有理由不学习他么?

当然我的目的是`机器学习`，不过无论什么目的学习Python还是很有必要的，Come On，陪着牧轩学Python吧！
